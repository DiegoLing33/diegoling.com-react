One, two,  three, four
Five… erm.. six?
Go…

I woke up from a bad dream,
What I have never seen.
I don’t know where I woke
But last time my life seems a joke.
I saw the clock is was about six p.m.,
I lose my work, like everyday I play the game…

Play in zero
It’s the game that I’ve owned,
But it's not what I want,
And I have to go on.

I've got a girl.
But it’s not girlfriend just a friend.
She has a boy.
But all the time she wants to spend
With me and I
I wanna her as much as well.
But it’s impossible,
She loves him and again I play…

Play in zero
It’s the game that I’ve owned,
But it's not what I want,
And I have to go on.

Oh it’s again, it’s the same,
Fucking day.
When I try go away,
Have to play fucking game..

Fucking blame,
It’s my chains,
And I can’t find escape.
It’s my game and I play…   

Play in zero
It’s the game that I’ve owned,
But it's not what I want,
And I have to go on.
