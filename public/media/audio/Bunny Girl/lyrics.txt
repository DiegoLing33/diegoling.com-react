When she’s coming there’s no sound,
It’s just hush.
She goes near, all around trying
Hide their eyes.

She’s so pretty she’s so beauty.
Blowing up the hearts...
She’s so kind, she’s so lovely,
Shaking up their mind...

Oh-oh, she’s a bunny girl,
Oh-oh, she’s whom always want.
Oh-oh, she’s a bunny girl,
Go bunny go darling go bunny girl!

Yeah, she’s a bunny girl,
She’s so cute and she’s so perfect.
She’s out of this world.

They want take, they want touch,
But she knows the price.
Be the greatest, do it better,
Maybe you will take the pride.

She’s got many friends, she’s social.
But they haven’t her.
Everyone follows her motions,
Every time she goes.

She’s got boyfriend, they don’t care
Cuz ‘em warriors.
Every one make everything
To get the glories.

Oh-oh, she’s a bunny girl,
Oh-oh, she’s whom always want.
Oh-oh, she’s a bunny girl,
Go bunny go darling go bunny girl

Yeah, she’s a bunny girl,
She’s so cute and she’s so perfect.
She’s out of this world.

They want take, they want touch,
But she knows the price.
Be the greatest, do it better,
Maybe you will take the pride.
